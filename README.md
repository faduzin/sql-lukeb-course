## The Analysis

This project focused on uncovering key insights about the data analyst job market. Each query was designed to address specific questions, shedding light on trends, opportunities, and essential skills. Here‚Äôs how I tackled each aspect of the analysis:

### *1. What are the top-paying jobs for Data Analysts?*

To identify the highest-paying roles, I focused on Data Analyst positions with non-null average yearly salaries. The query highlights remote opportunities ("Anywhere") and ranks them by salary, showcasing the top 10 highest-paying roles in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The query reveals the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles in the market, including their job titles, companies, and average yearly salaries.

### *2. What are the skills required for these top-paying roles?*

This query builds upon the top-paying Data Analyst jobs identified earlier by incorporating the specific skills required for each of those roles. It retrieves the job details, including titles, salaries, and company names, along with a list of associated skills, providing deeper insight into what makes these roles valuable. The results are ordered by salary, ensuring the highest-paying roles are highlighted first.

```sql

        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_postings_fact.job_title,
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name as company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```
