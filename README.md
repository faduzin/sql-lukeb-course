# SQL Data Analysis Project

This project is inspired by Luke Barousse's video course on SQL for data analysis. It demonstrates my implementation of database creation, data loading, and analysis using PostgreSQL.

## Overview

This project uses a database published by Luke Barousse to analyze data with SQL.\
The primary objectives include:

- Recreating the database from scratch using CSV files.
- Solving analysis questions posed in the video.
- Experimenting with SQL queries to explore the data further.

You can watch the video that inspired this project [here](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=D5pz3gTl8zcEJOOH), and check out Luke Barousse's channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse).

## Folder Structure

- **`project_sql`**: Contains 5 SQL files with my solutions to the analysis questions.
- **`sql_load_from_scratch`**: Files for creating the database and importing data from CSV files (my implementation).
- **`sql_load`**: Luke Barousse's implementation of the data-loading process.
- **`sql_testing_queries`**: A collection of SQL queries for exploring and experimenting with the database.

---

## Features

- **Database Creation**: Step-by-step scripts to create the database schema and load data using PostgreSQL.
- **SQL Analysis**: Solutions to questions focused on data insights.
- **Exploration**: Additional queries to deepen data understanding.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faduzin/sql-lukeb-course.git
   cd sql-lukeb-course
   ```
2. Navigate to `sql_load_from_scratch` to create the database and import the data. Follow the instructions in the README inside the folder.
3. Explore the analysis solutions in the `project_sql` folder.
4. Experiment with the queries in the `sql_testing_queries` folder.

---

## Future Plans

- Add and answer more data analysis questions beyond those covered in the video.
- Optimize and refine queries for better performance.
- Explore potential visualizations based on the SQL analysis results.
