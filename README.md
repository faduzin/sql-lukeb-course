## The Analysis

This project focused on uncovering key insights about the data analyst job market. Each query was designed to address specific questions, shedding light on trends, opportunities, and essential skills. Here‚Äôs how I tackled each aspect of the analysis:

### *1. What are the top-paying jobs for Data Analysts?*

To identify the highest-paying roles, I focused on Data Analyst positions with non-null average yearly salaries. The query highlights remote opportunities ("Anywhere") and ranks them by salary, showcasing the top 10 highest-paying roles in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The query reveals the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles in the market, including their job titles, companies, and average yearly salaries.

#### Key Insights based on the results:

- **Skill-Based Salary Variance:**
Certain skills, such as Pandas and NumPy, command significantly higher average salaries in remote roles compared to all jobs. For example, Pandas averages $151,821 in remote jobs, far exceeding most skills in all jobs.

- **Databricks Stands Out in Both Categories:**
Databricks appears as one of the top-paying skills in both all jobs ($112,881) and remote jobs ($141,907), showcasing its relevance and demand across job types.

- **Snowflake's Consistent Value:**
Snowflake remains a high-paying and widely in-demand skill in both categories, maintaining average salaries of around $111,578 (all jobs) and $112,948 (remote jobs).

- **Remote Jobs Favor Specialized Tools:**
Remote roles show a preference for specialized tools like Pandas, NumPy, and PostgreSQL, which have higher average salaries compared to their general counterparts.

#### Answer to the Question
The top skills based on salary for Data Analyst roles vary slightly between all jobs and remote jobs. For all jobs, GitLab, Kafka, and PyTorch dominate the top-paying skills. In remote jobs, skills like Pandas, NumPy, and Databricks lead the pack.

This analysis highlights that while some skills are universally valuable, certain tools and frameworks command a premium specifically in remote job markets. This could be due to the specialized nature of remote work environments requiring more advanced or niche technical expertise.
