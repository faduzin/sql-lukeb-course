## Tools I Used

To bring this project to life, I utilized a set of powerful tools:

- **SQL**: The foundation of my analysis, enabling detailed data exploration and query-building.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust database management system for efficiently organizing and querying the dataset.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred environment for writing and executing SQL scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my work with clarity and organization.

## The Analysis

This project focused on uncovering key insights about the data analyst job market. Each query was designed to address specific questions, shedding light on trends, opportunities, and essential skills. Here‚Äôs how I tackled each aspect of the analysis:

### *1. What are the top-paying jobs for Data Analysts?*

To identify the highest-paying roles, I focused on Data Analyst positions with non-null average yearly salaries. The query highlights remote opportunities ("Anywhere") and ranks them by salary, showcasing the top 10 highest-paying roles in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_postings_fact.job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The query reveals the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst roles in the market, including their job titles, companies, and average yearly salaries.

### *4. What are the top skills based on salary for Data Analysts?*

This query identifies the top skills based on average salary for Data Analyst roles. It calculates the average salary for each skill across job postings, filters for skills with at least 3 mentions, and retrieves the top 25 skills ranked by their average salary.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg)) AS avg_salary,
    COUNT(salary_year_avg)
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_postings_fact.job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
HAVING
    COUNT(salary_year_avg) > 3
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Here is a grouped bar chart comparing the average salaries for skills across all jobs and remote jobs. It highlights differences in compensation for each skill based on job type.

![Comparison of Average Salaries for All Jobs vs Remote Jobs by Skill](<assets/comparison-of-average-salaries-per-skill.png>)<figcaption>Bar graph comparing the average salaries for all jobs versus remote jobs by skill; ChatGPT generated this graph using merged SQL query results.</figcaption>

#### Key Insights based on the results:

- **Skill-Based Salary Variance:**
Certain skills, such as Pandas and NumPy, command significantly higher average salaries in remote roles compared to all jobs. For example, Pandas averages $151,821 in remote jobs, far exceeding most skills in all jobs.

- **Databricks Stands Out in Both Categories:**
Databricks appears as one of the top-paying skills in both all jobs ($112,881) and remote jobs ($141,907), showcasing its relevance and demand across job types.

- **Snowflake's Consistent Value:**
Snowflake remains a high-paying and widely in-demand skill in both categories, maintaining average salaries of around $111,578 (all jobs) and $112,948 (remote jobs).

- **Remote Jobs Favor Specialized Tools:**
Remote roles show a preference for specialized tools like Pandas, NumPy, and PostgreSQL, which have higher average salaries compared to their general counterparts.

#### Answer to the Question
The top skills based on salary for Data Analyst roles vary slightly between all jobs and remote jobs. For all jobs, GitLab, Kafka, and PyTorch dominate the top-paying skills. In remote jobs, skills like Pandas, NumPy, and Databricks lead the pack.

This analysis highlights that while some skills are universally valuable, certain tools and frameworks command a premium specifically in remote job markets. This could be due to the specialized nature of remote work environments requiring more advanced or niche technical expertise.


### *5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?*

This query identifies the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts by evaluating skills with significant demand (more than 10 job mentions) and high average salaries. It ranks skills based on their average salary and demand, providing insights into which skills offer the best combination of value and opportunities.

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) as demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

I ran a query to identify the top 25 skills with the highest salaries and demand across all jobs. Then, I filtered the query to focus only on remote jobs. Using the results, I generated a chart comparing the top 4 highest-paying skills in both contexts, highlighting the differences in value and demand between all jobs and remote roles.

![Top 4 Highest Salaries: All Jobs Vs Remote Jobs](<assets/top-4-highest-salaries.png>)<figcaption>Bar graph comparing the top 4 highest salaries for skills in all jobs versus remote jobs; generated from SQL query results to highlight key skill-based salary differences.</figcaption>

#### Key Insights based on the results:

- **Salary Variance Across Job Types:**
Certain skills, such as Kafka and Go, showcase significantly higher average salaries in all jobs and remote jobs, respectively. This indicates that specific skills are more valued depending on the job type.

- **Remote Roles Favor Specialized Tools:**
Skills like Confluence and Hadoop appear prominently in remote jobs, emphasizing the demand for collaboration and data processing tools in remote work environments.

- **Common High-Paying Skills:**
Snowflake is a consistent high-paying skill across both all jobs and remote jobs, highlighting its universal value in data analytics roles regardless of the job setup.

- **All Jobs Highlight Advanced Frameworks:**
Skills such as Kafka and TensorFlow rank higher in all jobs, suggesting their importance in broader enterprise or on-site data analysis projects.

#### Answer to the Question

The most optimal skills to learn depend on whether you are targeting all jobs or remote roles. For all jobs, skills like Kafka, PyTorch, and TensorFlow stand out with high average salaries and demand. For remote roles, skills like Go, Confluence, and Hadoop dominate, showcasing their importance in flexible work environments. However, universally valued skills like Snowflake appear in both contexts, making them a strong choice for any Data Analyst aiming to maximize opportunities.
